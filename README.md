JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.
You can declare a variable using let, const, or var.
To assign a string to a variable, use quotes like this: let name = "Alice";
The function keyword is used to define a function.
To output something in the browser console, you use console.log().
The data type that stores true or false values is called Boolean.
To compare two values for equality in value and type, use ===.
The loop that runs as long as a condition is true is the while loop.
In JavaScript, arrays are defined using square brackets.
An if statement checks for a condition to decide what code to run.
HTML elements can react to JavaScript using events like onclick.
The method to convert a string to a number is Number().
To add a new element to the end of an array, use array.push().
To check the length of a string, use string.length.
The operator + can be used for both addition and concatenation.
JavaScript code is typically run inside the web browser or using Node.js for server-side JavaScript.
You can use document.getElementById() to access an HTML element by its id.
The keyword used to stop the execution of a loop is break.
A function can return a value using the return keyword.
The typeof operator returns the type of a variable.
